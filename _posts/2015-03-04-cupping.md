Thank you to everyone who showed up to play on Sunday. The cupping was an awesome success but I wished I would have gotten better spoons for you all so you could have sipped your coffee. Next time we'll order some fancy cupping spoons from Japan. 

We also have an excess of coffee from the event so we will have some fresh Bali Blue Moon and Fuel for your Love next tiem. 

Boom.
