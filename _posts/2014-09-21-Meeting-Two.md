So thank you all for showing up despite work, practice, etc. Having even a handful of people come makes my day. 

This week we ran a little taste between single Origin Mexican and Columbian roasts. Jury is still out on that.

### YO
Add us on **Yo** @ PVCC.

### Next Week
Next week, I'm going to try and bring in a few different bags of *No. 6 Depot* to try out.

### Want to Host?
We're meeting again, next Sunday September 28th at 2pm. It'll be in Prospect Kitchen. If any of you can think of a better space, email me. You want to host Coffee Club in your dorm? That's cool, let me know.
