### Goals
Increase coffee awareness, interest, and flavour in the Williams College community. No more over-roasted over-saturated beans. No more high octane jet fuel quality espresso. This is to educate students about how to make coffee taste great through a variety of brewing methods. 

### Contribution?
This group will expose students, both familiar and unfamiliar to coffee and brewing, to new methods of production, different styles of beans, and some basic chemistry related to production. Students will learn how to make their own coffe, and will no longer rely on cafes.

### Facilitate
We will have weekly meet ups to brew together and learn new methods of brewing with the various devices that our group has collected. On tap would be Chemex, Kalita Wave, Aeropress, and Clever.

### Expenses
We will need money to purchase coffee beans from various sources not limited to but including: Blue Bottle Coffee, Counter Culture, Uncommon Grounds, Vermont Coffee Company, and Vermont Artisan Coffee. We will also need funds to purchase brewing devices such as, but not limited to: Clever, Chemex, BonMac Dripper, Kalita Wave, Hario v60, Hario v60 Buono Kettles, scales, and some mugs.

### Facilities Necessary
A kitchen. We literally will just need a kitchen with stove. We will be purchasing burr grinders, beans, and brewing devices.We will also be purchasing a few kettles. If we could acquire school provided storage to keep these safe, that would be preferred to using our own avenues for storage.
